					course (CS2005) at my university (Memorial University of NL),
					teams were assigned to make a game of barricades (Malefiz) from scartch 
					using Java. I helped with making the use case description and sequence 
					diagram, making UI for a window and
					algorithm to move a pawn in the game. Was not allowed to share GitHub Repository.

				 <p class="paragraphs"> Setup around a Raspberry Pi Zero, using DHT11 sensor for the ambient temperature 
					 and YL-69 sensor for the soil moisture reading, these data will be fed into Mongo Atlas using PyMongo from the pi, the nodeJS based server side 
					 will extract the collection from MongoDB using mongoose and that will be sent off to the client (Another page added to this website)
			         where the data will be on graph and the past data can view on a table directly on the website. Currently in the lookout for a Raspberry
					  pi 3 to replace my zero and resume my project, most of the backend and frontend work is done. Can be seen on my repository on GitHub (Currently in progress).

						  which was imported into MongoDB atlas, where we accessed the dataset to ultimately be sent to the client (The website) 
						  and have a chart displaying stats, Google maps API used to pin locations on the map from location information from the dataset, 
						  display our dataset sorted by the fatalities or number aboard the plane on that crash, and

						  everything on the front end in a visually appealing way.
